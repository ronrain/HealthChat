## Objective

Sports fans watch their favorite teams and yell at the players what they would do if they were playing. But, is your strategy really the best option? Now it's your turn to go out and play the game and prove that you will score and win the game. You must choose the correct option to continue onto the next situation to eventually score a goal. But be careful! If you choose the wrong option, there's a chance you might make a mistake and lose the game for your team.
